- Very nice to see you testing data ideas. Do adapt/refactor as you find weaknesses. 
- E.g. shop data, instead of "dataType": ["food", "water"] and "buyPrice": [50,40], would it not be better to put each shop item in its own object?

- Also, probably don't need to specify "img/..." in image urls in your JSON data, as all images will be in whatever image directory you choose (as that can be hardwired). Unless you plan to have more than one image/media directory, in which case it's fine. Just a thought.

# Henry's Comments 27/April
- looking good. Changelog especially looking good.
- compile instructions + directory explanation still missing in this file :)
